1) Working of goto label: -
  Example: -
  
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdint.h>

  int a;

  int main()
  {
        a = 4;
        printf("Value of a = %d\n", a);

        if(a > 5)
                goto err;

        printf("this test goto label\n");
  err:
        printf("a is greater than 5\n");

        return 0;
  }
  
  Output: - 
  Value of a = 4
  this test goto label
  a is greater than 5
  
  [So, here point to note is that printf() statement in "err" label is also
  printed.]
  
  If in above example, we set a = 6, then output will be as below: -
  Value of a = 6
  a is greater than 5
