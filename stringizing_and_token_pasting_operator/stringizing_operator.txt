Stringizing operator (#)
==========================
 The # operator, which is generally called the stringize operator, turns the argument it precedes into a quoted string.
 
Example 1: - 
-------------
#include <stdio.h>  
#define PrintExpr(x) (printf("%s = %d\n", #x, (x)))
#define UART_PIN        12

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	   PrintExpr(2+2);
     PrintExpr(UART_PIN);
	   return 0;
}

Output - 
  2+2 = 4
  UART_PIN = 12
Explanation -
  if we use #x, then it is considered as string. The argument x is 2+2, so #x will consider it as string.
