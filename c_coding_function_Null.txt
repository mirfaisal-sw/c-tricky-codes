We can use functions definition with some conditional compilation macro using #ifdef. We can 
keep functions definition under #ifdef. In #else we can deifine functrions symbol as NULL.
It is explained as below.

#ifdef CONFIG_PM

static int my_suspend_function (struct device *dev)
{
        struct my_pcie *my_pcie = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

        if (my_pcie->state == STATE_LINK_DOWN) {
                dev_info(dev, "[%s] PCIe interface controls PCIe link %d\n",
                        __func__, my_pcie->ch_num);
                my_pcie->s2r_if_control = true;
        } 
        .....
        .....

        return 0;
}

#else 
#define my_suspend_function       NULL
#endif


Result: - 
----------
If macro CONFIG_PM is disabled and if the function my_suspend_function() is used in code, then to avoid compilation error or symbol 
resolve error at run time, we can define this functions symbol "my_suspend_function" as NULL.
